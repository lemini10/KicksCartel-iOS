## Keywoards
- Shoes
- Sneakers resale

## Supported devices
Supported iPhone devices with portrait orientation. Wider screens with work better in further releases when the market increseases, specially when VIP customers had experience buying in a mobile App, by now the goal is to reach as much users as posible and that is achieved with most iPhone devices.

## Supported orientations,
We currently support just portrait orientation, as mentioned above or goal is to reach as many users as posibles and by working just with iPhones the screen available is too small to provide new funcionalities and will just increase the bug risk.

## Run the app
The authentication and all services are resolved with Firebase solutions (FirebaseAuth and Real Time Data Base) and the mentioned dependencies are fetched by SwiftÂ´s Native dependencie manager (SPM). You can create a new user in the profile tab for some features or just use the default user provided below.
