# KicksCartel Snkr Resale App
This app is intented to get closer and better experiencie between the most popular sneaker reseller in Latin America by providing a new, sharp, clear and portable experience.

## Supported devices
Supported iPhone devices with portrait orientation. Wider screens with work better in further releases when the market increseases, specially when VIP customers had experience buying in a mobile App, by now the goal is to reach as much users as posible and that is achieved with most iPhone devices.

## Supported orientations,
We currently support just portrait orientation, as mentioned above or goal is to reach as many users as posibles and by working just with iPhones the screen available is too small to provide new funcionalities and will just increase the bug risk.

## Run the app
The app uses Firebase's SDK through Swift Package Manager, so in theory there are no other extra steps except for building a running the app. With this said, you may have to fetch the latest version of the dependencies, you can achieve this by going to the file tab in Xcode's menu, and following the next steps:
`File -> Packages -> Resolve Package versions`
