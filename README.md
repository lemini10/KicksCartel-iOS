# JE Studio
JE Studio booking app, is an app for the JE Studio branches to manage in a better way the student's reservations, this enables the coaches to focus on making more and better classes, rather than writing down every student that asks for a class

## Supported devices
The app is designed to work on iPhones, future releases might consider iPad releases, but booking apps are way more commmon on users' phones.
Phones are tools that we carry with us all day long and in some cases they work as reminders. Given the app's core functionality is making appointments, it is way more useful to have it on your phone, right?

## Supported orientations
JE Studio app supports only portrait orientation since no media is displayed, for now the app can only be used in this orientation. Since this is just an MVP, future releases may include media of some type and then other orientations might be necessary

## Run the app
The app uses Firebase's SDK through Swift Package Manager, so in theory there are no other extra steps except for building a running the app. With this said, you may have to fetch the latest version of the dependencies, you can achieve this by going to the file tab in Xcode's menu, and following the next steps:
`File -> Packages -> Resolve Package versions`
